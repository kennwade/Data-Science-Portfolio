# Project Title: Time Series Forecasting - Global CO2 Emissions

## Overview
This project focuses on using time series analysis to forecast global CO2 emissions based on historical data. The analysis involves building models to predict future emissions and evaluating their accuracy.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes global CO2 emission data from the 1960s to 2020, providing insights into the trends of emissions over time.

- **Source**: Global CO2 emissions dataset

## Methodology
1. **Data Visualization**: Visualized the time series data to identify trends and seasonality.
2. **Model Building**: Built and tested ARIMA and exponential smoothing models to forecast future CO2 emissions.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using RMSE and visualized their predictions against actual data.

## Key Findings
The ARIMA model provided the best fit for predicting future CO2 emissions, though uncertainties remain due to unpredictable external factors.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Libraries: pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks under the `Global CO2 Emissions Forecasting` folder.

    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   I utilized SQLite, a lightweight relational database management system, to create and populate the `petsdb` database. The objective was to set up the database with sample data for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - First, I created a function to handle database connections with a retry mechanism to manage potential locking issues.\n",
    "   - Then, I implemented a function to execute SQL commands with retries.\n",
    "   - The process involved connecting to the SQLite database and dropping any existing tables to ensure a clean setup.\n",
    "   - I created the `persons` and `pets` tables within the database.\n",
    "   - After that, I inserted sample data into both tables.\n",
    "   - Finally, I committed the changes and closed the database connection, ensuring the database was ready for use."

# Project Title: SQLite Database Creation and Queries

## Overview
This project involves creating and querying an SQLite database for storing information about pets and their owners. The project demonstrates how to set up tables, insert data, and perform SQL queries to extract useful information.

## Dataset Description
This project uses a synthetic dataset of pet owners and their pets. The tables include:
- `persons`: Information about pet owners, including their name, age, and city.
- `pets`: Information about pets, such as pet name, type, and whether they have received treatment.

- **Source**: Synthetic data created for this project.

## Methodology
1. **Database Creation**: Created an SQLite database with tables for pet owners and pets.
2. **Data Insertion**: Inserted data into the tables using SQL.
3. **SQL Queries**: Performed various SQL queries to extract insights, such as the number of pets that have received treatment and the number of people who own more than one pet.

## Key Findings
Insights included the number of people who own multiple pets and how many pets have received treatment.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Libraries: sqlite3

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks under the `SQLite Database Creation and Queries` folder.

# Project Title: R/Python Refresher - Indonesia Tourism Destination

## Overview
This project analyzes the Indonesia Tourism Destination dataset, focusing on tourist ratings and trends across major cities in Indonesia. The goal is to explore how tourists rate different destinations and identify key trends in the data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes tourist attraction information for five major cities in Indonesia, along with tourist ratings.

- **Source**: Kaggle (Indonesia Tourism Destination dataset)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns and cleaned the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the distribution of tourist ratings using histograms, box plots, and bivariate plots.
3. **Modeling**: The focus was on visualizing trends rather than predictive modeling.
4. **Evaluation**: Insights were drawn from visualizing the relationships between tourist ratings and other factors.

## Key Findings
Tourist ratings were generally positive, with a normal distribution around 4.4. Certain destinations showed more consistent ratings, while others had more variability.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks under the `Indonesia Tourism` folder.

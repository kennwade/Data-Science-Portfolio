# Project Title: Using Data to Improve MLB Attendance

## Overview
This project analyzes attendance data for the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball (MLB) team. The goal is to identify key factors influencing attendance and make recommendations to improve game attendance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on Los Angeles Dodgers games, including factors such as weather, promotions, opponents, and attendance numbers.

- **Source**: Dodgers attendance data

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled, and new features (e.g., weekend indicator) were created.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations such as line plots, box plots, and correlation matrices were generated to explore the relationships between attendance and various factors.
3. **Modeling**: A regression model was built to predict attendance based on weather, promotions, and other features.
4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error and R-squared scores.

## Key Findings
Promotions like fireworks and bobbleheads significantly impact attendance, while weather has a minor effect. Weekends generally see higher attendance.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks under the `MLB Attendance` folder.
